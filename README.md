# MAGNETO-extended
All code files, datasets, and results from the paper "MAGNETO and DeepInsight: Extended Image Translation with Semantic Relationships for Classifying Attack Data with Convolutional Neural Networks" by Aeryn Dunmore, Adam Dunning, Julian Jang-Jaccard, Fariza Sabrina, and Jin Kwak. 

Original, unedited code can be found at: 


Code files: Include all the files to use both binary and multiclass classification versions of the modified MAGNETO and DeepInsight algorithm. We have implemented several new classifiers - Decision Trees and Random Forests - in the multiclass version.

Datasets: We have included the datasets we used, which are publicly available at the links below. Our datraset files include those in which the translated data is saved as images generated by the DeepInsight method and ready for use in MAGNETO.

Results: We have included a results file for each of our experiments which shows the training process complete with confusion matrices.
